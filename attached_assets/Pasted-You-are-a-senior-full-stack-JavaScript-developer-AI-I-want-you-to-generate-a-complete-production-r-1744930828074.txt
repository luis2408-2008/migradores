You are a senior full-stack JavaScript developer AI. I want you to generate a complete, production-ready, fully functional web application that helps migrants from around the world by providing critical and updated information about:

- Legal procedures
- Work opportunities
- Health and medical services
- Education
- Housing
- Human rights
- Emergency contacts and social support

The app must be 100% in *Spanish*. Every label, button, error message, content, and interface text must be in Spanish.

### Frontend:

Use a modern JavaScript stack with:

- Vite + React 18
- Tailwind CSS (latest version)
- DaisyUI or Shadcn/UI for styled components
- Framer Motion for beautiful and smooth animations
- Animate.css + AOS (Animate on Scroll) + GSAP for scroll and reveal animations
- React Hook Form + Zod for form validation
- Lucide React or Font Awesome for icons
- Dark mode support
- Fully responsive layout (mobile-first)

The UI must be elegant, modern, minimalist, and inspiring â€” designed with purpose, not just beauty. Use animations tastefully and with UX in mind.

### Backend:

Use a scalable Node.js backend with:

- Node.js + Express.js
- PostgreSQL as the database (persistent, NOT in-memory)
- Drizzle ORM or Prisma ORM
- User authentication using Passport.js (username, email, encrypted password)
- bcrypt for password hashing
- express-session with connect-pg-simple for session management
- API routes for login, register, logout, user data, and posts
- Environment variables managed with dotenv
- Validation, error handling, and security (helmet, cors, rate limiting if needed)

### Core Features:

- User registration with full name, username, email, and password
- Login/logout with sessions
- Users can write comments, questions, or share experiences
- Forum or discussion board (optional)
- Information categorized by country
- Admin panel or dashboard (optional)
- Animated homepage with mission statement
- 404 and error pages in Spanish
- Footer and navbar with links, social media, and contact

### Database:

- PostgreSQL database must be fully connected and persistent
- Must work in production (Render.com)
- Include the ability to seed the database with initial Spanish-language data for different countries (e.g. asylum in Colombia, jobs in Spain, healthcare in Chile)

### Deployment:

- Provide a ready-to-deploy render.yaml file
- Include a .env example file with environment variables
- Include build scripts and deployment instructions
- Must retain all data (users, comments, etc.) between deploys

This app must be 100% in Spanish, designed to be beautiful, accessible, mobile-friendly, and emotionally impactful. It should feel safe and empowering for migrants. The platform must be clean, fast, useful, and ready to be shared with the world.
